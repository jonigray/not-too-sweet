## Tattie Scones
### Notes
\*the thicker the better

\*don’t forget the salt in the dough process

\*dry fry is important

### Ingredients

*   500g potatoes (baby potatoes/any white do fine)
*   30g margarine / butter
*   200g self-raising flour
    
    
### Method

1.  **Cut potatoes** to even sizes. Skin them to your preference, (I prefer skin-on, it adds to the texture).
    
2.  **Boil** the potatoes until they come apart easily with a fork (15 mins in pre-boiled water, dependent on size).
    
3.  **Drain** and let the water at the bottom of the pot steam off for a minute.
    
4.  **Mash** the potatoes until desired consistency (for me I like little chunky bits throughout, and you’ll knead the dough plenty too).
    
5.  **Add margarine**/butter to the mash.
    
6.  **Add the flour in parts** until desired dough. Boiled potatoes will have different humidity dependent on how long they’ve been sitting after draining, and the type of potato. Any consistency where it’s not too sticky will do fine.
    
7.  **Salt** to taste.
    
8.  **Split dough** into three.
    
9.  Clean and flour a work surface.
    
10.  Heat up a large non-stick frying pan (no oil, dry pan) to a middle-high heat (on my stove it’s 5.5 out of 9 heat settings).
    
11.  Take one of the dough thirds and **flatten it** (smack it/roll it) out into a circle. (Thick circles, go for 0.5 to 1cm).
    
12.  **Cut your dough** circle into quarters for 4 even-sized triangles.
    
13.  When pan is hot, **transfer in the scones** and **let them get golden** on each side. (Dry pan, don’t add any oil/butter).
    
14.  **Cool on a rack** if storing or serve hot.

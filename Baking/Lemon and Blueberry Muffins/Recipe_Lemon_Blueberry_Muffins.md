### Notes
\*In my muffin tin I need to use two cases per muffin otherwise they flop out like fat cupcakes instead of tall muffins. 

\*Recipe adapted from [alexandracooks](https://alexandracooks.com/2009/03/20/lemon-blueberry-muffins/) with changes to the rising agents/salt mix, sugar level, and some of the method. 


### Ingredients

*   115g margarine / butter
*   1 lemon (zest)
*   160g sugar + 3 tsp
*   1 free-range egg (room temp)
*   1 tsp vanilla
*   250g plain flour
*   1 $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp baking powder
*   $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp salt
*   2 cups (380g) fresh blueberries
*   120ml soy milk / dairy milk
    
    
### Method

1.  Preheat the oven to 175C for top-bottom heating, or 165C for fan. Prepare the rack in the lower third of the oven.
    
2.  Line a 12-part muffin tray with double muffin cases (see notes).
    
3.  Prep the dry ingredients: in a medium bowl whisk together 200g of the flour, baking powder and salt, set the bowl aside.

4.  Toss the other 50g of flour in with the washed and dried blueberries. 
    
5.  Beat together the margarine/butter, lemon zest and and 160g sugar until fluffed, then add the egg and vanilla, beating well. 
    
6.  Fold in the dry ingredients and milk part-by-part. When the last part is almost mixed in, add the blueberries too. Do your best not to overmix the batter. The batter will be quite thick. 
    
7.  Spoon the batter into the muffin cases. Sprinkle one light tsp of sugar over each row of the muffins.
    
8.  Bake for 18-25 minutes. Skewer in the center of a muffin to check if they're ready (skewer will return clean or with crumbs). 

9.  When baked, let the muffins cool in the pan for a few minutes before removing to cool on wire rack (or serve immediately).

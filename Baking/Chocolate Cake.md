## Moist Chocolate Cake
### Notes
\*oatly whipping cream is an easier way to make ganache than dairy double cream

\*often times I do 250g chocolate and 250ml oatly cream, just because the pack comes in 250ml

\*adapted from BBC good food 'easy chocolate cake' recipe

\*this recipe also works as one big old traybake

### Ingredients

**Cake**

*   175g caster sugar
*   100g dark brown sugar
*   85g cocoa powder
*   1 $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp baking powder
*   1 $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp bicabonate of soda
*   2 free-range eggs
*   250ml soy milk/dairy milk
*   125ml vegetable oil
*   2 tsp vanilla extract
*   225g plain flour
*   250ml boiling water

**Ganache**

*   200g dark chocolate
*   200ml oatly whipping/double cream

    
### Method

1.  Preheat the oven to 170C for top-bottom heating, or 160C for fan.
    
2.  Grease and line two 20cm sandwich tins.
    
3.  Place all the ingredients, except the flour and boiling water, in a large bowl. Beat until combined.
    
4.  Fold in the flour (can be easier to do it in parts).
    
5.  Add the boiling water, a little at a time, until you have a very wet smooth batter.
    
6.  Half the batter between the sandwich tins.
    
7.  Bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes. The top should be firm, and a skewer through the center should come out clean.
    
8.  Remove the cakes and allow to cool completely. Remove from the tins when cooled.
    
9.  If using oatly whipping cream for the icing: 
  a.  Melt the chocolate au bain marie and when fully melted, take of the heat.
  b.  Add the oatly cream piece by piece and whisk (I use an electric beater) until it is well combined and airy.
    
10.  If using dairy double cream for the icing: 
  a.  Heat the chocolate and cream together in a pan on low heat until the chocolate melts. 
  b.  Remove the pan from the heat and keep whisking until the mixture is smooth, glossy and thickened. 
    
11.  Set the icing/ganache aside to cool and thicken for 1-2 hours, until thick enough for spreading over the cake. (1 hour tends to be enough each time, my kitchen is quite cold). 
    
12.  Assemble by cutting flat the top of one of the cakes (this will be the bottom half), and spreading half the icing/ganache onto each of the cakes. 

13.  Stack the cakes and serve.

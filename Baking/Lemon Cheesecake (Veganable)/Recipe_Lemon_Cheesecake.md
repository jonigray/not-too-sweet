## Lemon Cheesecake

<img src="###" alt="###" width="300"/>

### Notes
\*Using margarine instead of butter in this recipe will result in a softer base, but it will still hold well. 

\*The thickness of your cream cheese and double cream as individual ingredients will make an important difference in producing a cheesecake that won't fall apart. Violife cream cheese is slightly thicker than dairy cream cheese; oatly whipping cream is thinner than dairy cream _but_ thickens up in the fridge more than standard dairy cream. So I was able to increase the cream:cheese ratio (closer to 1:3). The original recipe using standard dairy products was at a ratio closer to 1:4.

\*If this recipe went well I could dare to add another 50ml of cream with the same amount of cheese. Trying to bulk out the recipe with cheaper product...

### Ingredients

**Base**

*   180g gingernuts
*   60g margarine / butter (melted) 

**Filling**

*   400g cream cheese (I used violife's vegan)
*   80g icing sugar, sifted
*   2 lemons
*   125ml double cream (I used oatly's whipping)
*   50g lemon curd

    
### Method
**Base**

1.  Grease and line a small springform / loose-bottom tin. For this quantity I used a 7.5inch round for a shallow cake.
    
2.  Melt the margarine/butter in a metal/glass bowl au bain marie. 
    
3.  Blitz the gingernuts in a food processor until they're crumbs.
    
4.  Add the biscuit crumbs to the melted margarine/butter.

5.  Tip the crumb mix into the lined tin and press it down into an even layer with the bottom of a cup. 

6.  Chill in the fridge for 40 minutes to an hour. 

**Filling**

5.  Zest and juice the lemons: zest into a large mixing bowl, juice kept in a small bown until required.
    
6.  Into the large mixing bowl with zest, add cream cheese and sift in the icing sugar. Beat the mix to loosen up the cream cheese. 
    
7.  Add 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice and beat again until smooth. Pour in the cream and continue beating until the cream has whipped for a thick mixture (pulling out the beaters leaves very stiff peaks).
    
8.  Spoon the filling into the tin and spread it out evenly over the base. Smooth the top.
    
9.  Chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.
    
10.  To serve, remove the cheesecake from the tin, peel of the lining. Decorate at preference (with mint, candied lemon, lemon curd drizzle, gingernut crumbs, etc).

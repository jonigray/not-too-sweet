### Notes
\*The first time I made this it was too sweet, this recipe version is adjusted to be less sweet. 

\*The first time I made this it was too wet in the middle while drying out too much on the edges as I tried to bake low and slow. Have updated cooking temp to this version. 

\*Recipe adapted from [tamingtwins](https://www.tamingtwins.com/lemon-drizzle-cake-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-12146) with changes to the sugar level, and some of the method. 


### Ingredients

**Cake**

*   250g margarine / butter (softened)
*   175g caster sugar
*   4 free-range eggs
*   250g self-raising flour
*   3 lemons (zest only)

**Icing**

*   150g icing sugar
*   2 lemons (juice of)

    
### Method

1.  Preheat the oven to 175C for top-bottom heating, or 160C for fan. Prepare the rack in the lower third of the oven.
    
2.  Grease and line a loaf tin.
    
3.  Beat together the margarine/butter, sugar and lemon zest until fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. 

4.  Fold in the flour until incorporated. Don't overmix.  
    
5.  Pour the batter into the lined tin and smooth the top. 
    
6.  Bake for 40-50 minutes, until a skewer into the center of the cake comes out clean. 
    
7.  Let the cake cool on a wire rack in the tin.
    
8.  Prepare the drizzle. We're going for 2 mixtures, one thin and one thick.  

9.  Weigh out all of the icing into one bowl, and add a quarter teaspoon of lemon juice at a time (until no more than 3/4 tsp have been used), mixing the sugar into a paste before thinning it out to avoid clumps. 

10.  Split the paste icing into two small bowls/cups. Add lemon juice 1/4 tsp at a time to each until one bowl is just dripping off of the spoon/whisk; and the other bowl until it is thin and runny. The first bowl will be used later to decorate the top of the cake. 

11.  While the cake is still warm in the tin (not piping hot), use a skewer to make multiple holes into the cake. Then, using the thin/runny icing mixture, pour the icing into over the holes to soak the cake with the mix. 

12.  Then, once the cake is fully cooled, remove the tin and lining from the cake. With the cake sitting on a wire rack (over a cleanable surface), pour the thicker, decorative icing over the top of the cake. 

13.  Let the icing set for a while before serving - tastes great with yogurt! 10-12 slices.
